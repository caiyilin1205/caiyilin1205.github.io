### About this site

Hi there! I’m Yilin Cai, and I built this website to share a bit of who I am — my projects, interests, and journey through biostatistics, data science, and computational biology.

This site is a mix of my academic work, coding projects, and personal hobbies. I designed and coded it myself using R Markdown, keeping it simple, clean, and easy to navigate.

If you’re curious about how it’s built (or just like exploring code), you can check out the source files on my GitHub page. Thanks for visiting. I hope you enjoy exploring!
